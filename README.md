# DeepLearning

The architecture inspiring the Neural Network is [U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation
](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net/)


## Training
We trained the model with 40 epochs and a batchsize of 5.


## Assignment Info
Due to sensitive data, we are not permitted to share the images used for training. Therefore a Jupyter Notebook is not added to this Github.
All scripts and code used for "SEGMENTING CAR PARTS USING INTERNAL DATASET" is included in this Github, excluding image data and trained model (due to size limitations)
